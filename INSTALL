INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

To compile and install for host:
--------------------------------

./rebuild-host.sh


To cross-compile for platform hardware and install to the jevois-sdk:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

./rebuild-platform.sh -DJEVOIS_MODULES_TO_BUILDROOT=ON

The package will be included next time you flash a custom microSD card using jevois-build.sh in jevois-sdk.

To cross-compile for platform hardware and install to jvpkg package:
--------------------------------------------------------------------

./rebuild-platform.sh
cd pbuild
